      <h3>Welcome to the Outlands!</h3>
      <p align="left">The last Cosmic War ended with the shattering of countless worlds. 
                    As they were torn apart an attempt was made to save some of their populations. 
                    Shards of the shattered worlds were pushed into an artificial dimensional construct, 
                    and the Outlands was born.</p>
      <p align="left">The Outlands is a place to explore and adventure with the heroes and 
          crew that you recruit from the planes. Discover new planes, 
          overcome troubles that plague the Outlands, search through ruins of the 
          past, and uncover cosmic relics.  </p>
      <p align="left">This is an experimental game built upon Ethereum - an emerging technology. 
          For those familiar - it is a dApp. You do not need to use Ethereum to play 
          the game. However, if you do use Ethereum you can unlock more functionality, 
          and you can help shape the game as you play. Currently the game runs on the 
          Kovan network - and if you want to utilize all aspects of the game you should pick
           up some Kovan Ether. </p>
      <p align="left">You start with five heroes and a small amount of Diamond. Use it to recruit heroes, 
          crew and buy gear. Spend it wisely. 
          </p>
